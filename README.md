# Tour of Heroes &trade;

> ### Angular application that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.

This application has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

## Functionality overview

- Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
- Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
- Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
- Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
- Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
- Enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view.
- Format data with pipes.
- Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.
- Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.
